// ! Here ....we used the same logic of BinarySearch as in the previous question ...but here instead of drawing the line from 
// ! the median ... here we draw a line such that left part contains k elements...so if we are able to find a combination
// ! across the partition( in which left partition has k elements) ..that will give us the sorted array then we can find the 
// ! adjacent elements from this line...also what we observe is if we are keeping k-elements in the left portion then the 
// ! max(l1,l2) will always be our answer.... :)


// But we need to do a slight change here in the pointers that is low & high....what we are given in the question is to find the
// kth element in the sorted array...which means we are keeping k -elements in the left...so we know we are applying 
// binarySearch on jow many elements to take from the smaller array....so high represents the maximum number of elements we can
// pick...but lets say nums1.size() = 5 ....and we want k=2 elements....so do we need to check by placing 3,4 or 5 elements in 
// the left...no right? ....so we only need to check till min(nums1.size(),k) ....now why min(nums1.size(),k) ....because 
// suppose we have nums1.size()=5 and nums2.size()=6 ...and k = 10 ...then we need to check for all the elements of the nums1
// right ? otherwise we won't be able to get 10th element.. similarly we need to change the low pointer as well....
// what low indicates is the minimum number of elements to pick from the smaller array...that's why it is starting from 0...now
// it will work fine in cases like say k = 2 ...then we can have low as 0....because then we have combination like ...left=2 &
// right=9...where in left we have number of elements as nums1=0 and nums2 = 2....now suppose we have case where k=7...now 
// to make this can we take low=0 ...no because if we take low=0...because the maximum length of nums2 is itself 6 ..so even if
// we pick all elements from nums2 we still won't be able to make the desired combination...so we need at least 1 right ...
// from nums1 ...which means we need.... `low = max(0,7-6)` ...which means max(0,k-n2)...where n2=nums2.size()..... :) 

// Keeping in mind this conditions everything will be fine....



// ! Again repeating the same thing as it is very-very important !!! ...we have two sorted arrays given and we need to find the
// ! kth element when we sort them..now imagine u have merged the two sorted arrays into a combined sorted array....then 
// ! if u draw a partition line between any two elements of the merged sorted array ...we know the left part will be sorted as
// ! well as right part will be sorted too right ? ...and wherever we do partition  we know how many elements are in the left 
// ! partition and how many in the right partition are there...so can we say as the given two arrays are also sorted...so we
// ! can pick the elements in such way that we have required number of elements in the left...ans we check that if this 
// ! combination is valid...and if it is valid ..then we can find the elements just adjacent to the line where we divided..^_^
