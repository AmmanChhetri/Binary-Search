// Approach 1 - LinearSearch (Brute Force)...

// Intuition - As we are required to find the minimum value of divisor...and divisor can be anything from 1 to 
//             max(nums[])...now why till max(nums[]) ..because the result obtained by taking max(nums[]) as divisor ..will be 
//             same as for any divisor > max(nums[])..so it is pointless to search ....

// Logic - the moment we get our answer...we store it and berak from loop ...as we need to print the minimum...
int linearSearch(vector<int> &nums, int threshold) {

    int ans = -1;

    int mxm = findMax(nums);

    // we are checking from the the divisor 1 because...suppose the thresold value is greater than or equal to the sum of all 
    // numbers of threshold...in that case our divior will always be `1`...as we need to get the lowest possible divisor....
    for(int i = 1;i<=mxm;i++) {
        if(isPossible(nums,threshold,i)){
            ans = i;
            break;
        }
    }


    return ans;

    // Time complexity is O(mxm*n) ...where n = nums.size() ....and mxm = maximum value of the nums[]....the worst case occurs
    //  when we have to search till mxm....and this will only happen if the thershold is very lesss..


    // Now there can be a follow up question like ...suppose we have a array = {1,2,3,4} ...and threshold as `3` ...now tell 
    // me ...for which minimum value of divisor will give the result lesser than or equal to threshold....the answer is 
    // `there is no possible value`....why? because the thresold value should be atleast the length of the array...here the
    //  threshold(3) < nums.size()...that's why it is not possible....because the minimum threshold we can obtained from a 
    // given nums array is when we take our divisor as the max(nums[])...so whenver we take our divisor as max(nums[])...our
    //  result will always be length of nums[]...so if the given threshold value is less than this result then the answer is 
    // not possible....
}









// Approach - 2 ... Binary Search
// Intuition - As we can see our answer space is lying in between [1,max(nums[])]...which is sorted ...and also as we are
//             looking for a value....and as we know that the whole answer space is divided into two sections....one where 
//             answer is possible and one where ans is not possible...and we look at the possible answer section...which means 
//             we are removing the section which is not possible....all this are enough reason to apply `binarySearch`....now
//             what the sections mentioned here means ..suppose if we are finding divisor ans we see got 5 as of now as our 
//             answer...now we know all the numbers after 5 wont fit for our search space...even if they yield a result of 
//             lesser threshold value...because we 5 will be the minimum among them..which we want...and if 5 is the temporary 
//             answer....threfore there is a chance we might get a lesser answer...in the range [1,5)...so our search sapce is
//             like...         1   2  3  4   5  6  7  8  9  10 ...so on..
//                             âœ“  âœ“  âœ“  âœ“  âœ“  ðŸ—´  ðŸ—´  ðŸ—´  ðŸ—´  ðŸ—´

// .... as we can see our answer space is divided into possible and not possible sections..... :)


// Logic -    Suppose we are standing at a particular divisor(mid)...now using this divior we got our result greater then 
//            threshold...which simply means..our divisor value is less....(because as we are dividing nums[i]/divisor)...so if
//            we want to reduce this divison value we need to increase divisor value....now suppose for a particular divisor 
//            we got divisor result lesser than or equal to threshold we can say this point(mid)...may be our answer....but we
//            need to check if there are any lesser value of mid...which aso gives divison result lesser than or equal to 
//            threshold... (Which is our ultimate goal ...to get the lowest divisor....)
