// Brute Force
// Logic - a number in a cell is peak element ...if it is greater than it's adjacent elements...(ie. top,bottom,left,right)..
//         so basic approach is to traverse through each element and check it's adjacent elements...also as it is given that
//         the given matrix is surrounded by -1 on all it's sides...which means...we need to initialize the variable with -1 ..
//         to prevenent from runtime error(dure to indexing)....

    // Time Complexity is O(4*m*n) ... as we are traversing n*m matrix..and at each steps we are checking in 4 directions..

// Better Solution ...
// There is a slight better solution from BruteForce approach,for this problem...if we see carefully we need to return the index
// of the element which is greater than all adjacent elements right? ....so think logically ...can't we return the index of the
// largest element of the matrix ü§ê....we can !!...because as it is the largest so it will be definitely greater then adjacent
// elements...

// Optimal - (Binary Search)...
// The intuition for this problem is combination of intuition of finding peak element in the 1D array and the intuition we used 
// in the `better-Approach` of the same problem....

// intuition of finding peak-element in the 1D array - suppose we are at a point i, if to the left of i we have lower elements
// (ie. nums[i-1] < nums[i]) ...then which means we need to move right..to go to the peak ....similarly if we have higher 
// elements to the left of i (ie nums[i-1] > nums[i]) ...which means to go the peak ...we need to go to left....that is towards
// higher element...(imagine the mountain ‚õ∞Ô∏è for better understanding) ....

// intuition we used in the better-approach of the same problem ...the maximum element will always be the peak element in a 2D
// matrix ...because it will always be greater than it's adjacent elements....

// suppose we have....{{4,2,5,1,4,5},
//                    {2,9,3,2,3,2},
//                    {1,7,6,0,1,3},
//                    {3,6,2,3,7,2}} ....
// let's say we're applying binarySearch on the columns ...that is [0,m-1] ...initially our mid point is 2 ...so think logically
// in column 2..which element has the maximum probability of being the peak-element...ahm...ofCourse the lasrgest element..
// so in column 2 largest element is 6...now we check the left and right of 6 only...why left and right only ...becasue as it is
// the maximum element of the column we know the value above and below 6 will definitely lesser than this element 6....
// we check right of 6...we have 0 ...as 0<6 ...so it's correct....to the left of 6 we have 7 ...which means 7>6 ...which means
// 6 is not a peak element...now ask yourself...where will you move...left or right...if u compare this case with 1-D peak 
// problem we have to move left..wo we are at ist column now...again mid = 0 ...now which element in the 0th column has the max
// probability of being peak ...ahm 4(as it is highest in the column)...so if we check ...it is greater than it's right and left..
// so we say this is our peak element...

// ! Now why always we are looking for a max element in a column because it has the highest probability of being the peak...its
// ! not compulsary though that this will be definitely a peak...

// ! next why are we only checking left and right because ...we are at a max element of that row right? ...so we know above
// ! and below this max element...will have elements that will be lesser than max element...

// ! now how are we deciding where to move is ...simple..suppose we are a particular element ...say 6 for example which will be
// ! the max element of this column...so we know top and bottom elements of this 6 are lesser than 6...now lets say i assume the
// ! right element of 6 is also lesser than 6....but the left element is greater than 6....from this point 6...we can move either
// ! left or right...but we will  move to the direction that has larger element than the one we are standing...its because
// ! say we have 7 to the left of 6 ...so if we move to the column of 7 ...and say 7 is the maximum element of this column...so
// ! again it is sure that 7 is larger than its top and bottom element...now this 7 will also be greater than its right element
// ! which is 6 ...so u see how are search has been reduced now.. 
// ! Now u may ask ..what if the 7 is the not the maximum element of that column...suppose in that column we have a number 9 as
// ! well so we now max is 9...so tell logically do we need to check the right now again? ...no because we moved to this column
// ! because 7>6 ...and 6 was the maximum element of his column...so 9>7...which means 9>6...right? ...which means to the right
// ! of 9...whichever element is present it will be also less than 9...because to the right of 9 we have the column which has 
// ! maximum as 6...so it's obvious 9>element to it's right...so this is how we are searching....by reducing space..

// When we moved to 7 from 6 ...as 7>6..then we can say 7 is greater than every element of the column having this 6..which 
// ultimately means 9 > all elements of the column having this 6...so this is how we are reducing our search space...now this 9
// is greater than its right element...so we just need to check for the left now...and even if we dont have anything in the left
// we need to consider we have -1..so which means this method always work....
